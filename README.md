# Kotlin-App
A simple app created with Kotlin to track and record food and calories.

This simple app will allow a user to keep track of a daily food diary. The user will be given two text fields in which they will enter a food and the food's calories.  
Clicking the "Add Food" button will then add their respective inputs into the food diary, as well as update the total calories shown in the bottom. Each item in the food diary may be removed by clicking its corresponding check box and then the clear button. If a user wants to clear the whole food diary they may click the "Select All" button which will check every item, then press the clear button.

As a lover of fitness and programming I wanted to challenge myself with a language and programming style I've never done before. So I combined my passions to create a simple
fitness related app. As I hope to pursue some form of app development in my professional career this was a good first venture into programming with Kotlin.

# Development Environment

For this project I used Android Studio. Android Studio was a really nice IDE to use as the XML files are very easily manipulated within this IDE, which made for easy
formatting and arranging of the GUI.

For this app I used Kotlin. I used the kotlin android extensions library to aid with importing within the project.

# Future Work

This app is very simple in it's design. I hope to return and improve on these things:

- Adding a macro tracker feature
- Using different activies to create a better flowing app
- Splash screem
- General GUI improvements
